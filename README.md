# jRisk

A Risk Clone written in Java. Backend at the moment, but will become a full game, using javaFX, when I feel up to implementing that.
Updates most likely will be sporadic. 

# What Works?

- Creates a very very very very basic board. 2D Array.
  - Adjacents! This time for reals.
  - Whole game works:
      - Creates 2 players
      - Has menu for certain moves
      - Distributes Armies.
  - Does almost everything that Risk does, MINUS Cards, and Continent Bonus's.
  
# To Do:

- AI
  - Implement JavaFx for a nice looking board and a menu for abilities.
  - Create a class for Cards.
  - Link list for info on what territories player owns.
  - Let more than two players play. Started work on that. While travelling.
