# jRisk
A Risk Clone written in Java. Backend at the moment, but will become a full game, using javaFX, when I feel up to implementing that.
Currently out of town for 9 days so updates will be sporadic.

# What Works?
  - Creates a very very very very basic board.
  - Adjacents!
  - Whole game works:
      - Creates 2 players
      - Has menu for certain moves
      - Distributes Armies.
  - Does everything that Risk does, MINUS Cards, and Continent Bonus'.
  
# To Do:
  - AI
  - Implement JavaFx for a nice looking board and a menu for abilities.
  - Create a class for Cards.
  - Link list for info on what territories player owns.
  - Let more than two players play. Started work on that. While travelling.

# Questions?
  - DM me, or Follow my Twitter @TopTierPanda
  - Feel free to Fork, it's a very good base.
  - Only for Educational Purposes, not for cheating, use it as a reference if you see fit, but don't come crying if you get a zero or expelled.
